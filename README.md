# NHS Scotland Healthcare Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This Power BI-based interactive dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of NHS Scotland’s healthcare system, focusing on key insights such as:

- **Hospital resource allocation**: Bed occupancy rates across hospitals.
- **A&E waiting time analysis**: Trends in emergency department waiting times.
- **Weather impact on consultations**: The correlation between weather patterns and hospital visits.

The dashboard is designed to be fully interactive, allowing users to explore healthcare trends, filter data dynamically, and gain valuable insights for resource planning.
