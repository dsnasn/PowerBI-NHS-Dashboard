Non-NHS Provider,"Non-NHS Provider figures relate to patients treated in non-NHS locations such as private hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, care homes, etc. Patients who receive treatment paid for by the respective NHS Board at a private (independent) hospital should be recorded within the SMR by the relevant NHS Board. However, if a patient is treated privately (where treatment is paid for by the patient or a private insurer) and there is no NHS involvement, then this activity will not be recorded within the SMR.

The data recording/completeness of non-NHS provider data varies from year to year. PHS does not collate information on the completeness of activity recorded by non-NHS providers, and such data may not be reflective of all non-NHS provider activity. Therefore, please treat any data provided with caution. It should also be noted that any changes in activity (both increases and decreases) are based on small numbers, which will impact on the percentage change.","Non-NHS Provider figures relate to patients treated in non-NHS locations such as private hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, care homes, etc. Patients who receive treatment paid for by the respective NHS Board at a private (independent) hospital should be recorded within the SMR by the relevant NHS Board.

National Facility NHS Louisa Jordan,"NHS Louisa Jordan undertook day case activity (across several specialties) from January 2021 up until the end of March 2021, when the hospital closed.","NHS Louisa Jordan undertook outpatient activity (across several specialties) from July 2020 up until the end of March 2021, when the hospital closed.

SMR00 has been used to capture return outpatient activity, as this has not been submitted to the ISD(S)1 dataset.",
Scotland,"The volume of hospital activity and trends observed continue to be impacted post pandemic and during the recovery phase. For example, inpatient and day case activity reduced by 5% when comparing April-June 2024 to the same quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic). However, activity levels have generally been recovering from July 2020 onwards. Inpatient and day case activity has increased by 3% when comparing April-June 2024 to the same quarter last year.

NHSScotland SMR01 data are estimated to be 97% complete for the for the quarter ending June 2024. There are some outstanding records yet to be submitted and some data quality issues to be aware of.

Total inpatient and day case activity increased in most boards. The largest mainland board increase was in NHS Tayside (+13.0%) while the largest decrease was in NHS Fife (?0.8%).

NHS Dumfries & Galloway, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, and the National Waiting Times Centre (NWTC) were the only boards where all elective and emergency inpatient and day case activity increased.   

Many trends observed will be influenced by (and attributable to) the data completeness levels, small numbers and the impact of COVID-19 highlighted above. Therefore, caution should be taken when comparing quarterly information.

NHSScotland SMR00 data (relating to new attendances only) are estimated to be 99% complete for the quarter ending June 2024. There are some outstanding records yet to be submitted and some data quality issues to be aware of.

Please note that there are several NHS Boards where the Data Management Team is unable to accurately measure completeness, as coding reports are not received from these NHS Boards. The NHS Boards affected are Borders, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Highland, Orkney and Shetland. Reported completeness figures may change as more information becomes available.

Outpatient activity increased in most boards. The largest mainland board increase was in NHS Fife (+8.5%) while the largest decrease was in NHS Dumfries & Galloway (-3.5%), which may be attributed to the slightly lower completeness levels.

DNA rates increased in most boards. The largest mainland board DNA rate was in NHS Tayside (8.8%) and the smallest DNA rate was in NHS Grampian (5.5%).

Most NHS Boards decreased their average available staffed beds for acute specialties. The largest mainland board decrease was in NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde (-2.2%) while the largest increase was in the National Waiting Times Centre (NWTC) (+10.6%).

The percentage occupancy increased in most boards. The largest mainland board increase in percentage occupancy was in NHS Forth Valley (+5.9 percentage points) while the largest decrease was in NHS Lanarkshire (-3.8 percentage points).
  
The percentage occupancy was higher than 90% in fewer than half the boards. The largest mainland board percentage occupancy was in NHS Ayrshire & Arran (97.2%) while the smallest percentage occupancy was in the National Waiting Times Centre (NWTC) (76.6%).

Unknown Health Board,,"Unknown Health Board refers to locations or residences that cannot be attributed to any of the other NHS Boards. Sharp increases were observed in this category from April 2020 onwards. For example, new outpatient  ' unknowns '  increased tenfold when comparing the period April-June 2020 to January-March 2020. The main reason for these increases is the submission of records with an 'unknown location' code ('D299N: Location not otherwise coded'). This results in the Health Board of treatment not being derived. Instead of being allocated to the actual NHS Board, the activity is instead categorised against Unknown Health Board.

Increased use of the  'unknown location' code can be attributed to uncertainty in the provision of outpatient clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinics are set up as a mixture of face-to-face, telephone, video link and 'Near Me' appointments. However, this code has been used as a workaround during the pandemic when the location of activity was not known. This made the setting-up of clinics simpler in TrakCare. The unknown location code has been used by several NHS Boards, predominantly by NHS Tayside and NHS Borders, although use of the code substantially decreased from 2021/22 onwards. New outpatient 'unknowns' are now back to similar pre-pandemic levels.

Data Management is looking at identifying codes that boards could use to correctly derive the health board of treatment, and the intention is that records already submitted using this code will be recoded.
